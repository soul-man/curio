## Run the development server

###Install:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables:

To configure your Next.js application with the necessary environment variables, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the root of your project if it doesn't already exist.

2. **Add the following environment variables** to the `.env.local` file:

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key_here
   NEXT_MORALIS_API_KEY=your_moralis_api_key_here
   NEXT_HOST_BASE_URL=your_host_base_url_here
   NEXT_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_twitter_bearer_token_here
   NEXT_TONCENTER_RPC_API_KEY=your_toncenter_rpc_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Replace the placeholder values** with your actual API keys and URLs.

These environment variables will be accessible in your application via `process.env`, allowing you to securely use sensitive information without hardcoding it into your source code.

###Start the server using this command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`.
